# Logistic-Regression


In this project, I have tried to make logistic regression model from scratch (only by using numpy), which can be treated as simplest from of neural network. I have made this model without using any API's like tensorflow or sk-learn.

In this project we try to to classify the given picture as 'Cat' or 'Non-cat' picture.

This project was given as programming assignment in WEEK-2 of Andrew-Ng's Deep Learning specialization course on coursera.

Currently this model have test acuraccy of around 70% and training accuracy of around 99%.
